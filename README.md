## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Create and use variables to store different types of data
- Perform arithmetic operations using Python operators
- Concatenate strings to create meaningful output
- Combine variables and expressions to solve real-world problems
- Apply proper Python syntax and formatting conventions

## Lab Structure

   - Create ASCII art by completing a house drawing
   - Focus on exact formatting and string output

2. **`song_lyrics.py`** - *Exercise 2: Variables and String Concatenation*
   - Store song lyrics in separate variables
   - Combine variables using string concatenation
   - Print the complete lyric on a single line

3. **`diff_prod_avg.py`** - *Exercise 3: Arithmetic Operations*
   - Calculate difference, product, and average of two numbers
   - Use arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %)
   - Practice formatted output with f-strings

4. **`calculate_time.py`** - *Exercise 4: Applied Problem Solving*
   - Solve a real-world time calculation problem
   - Use modular arithmetic (% operator)
   - Get user input and process it mathematically

### Study Materials (`module-1-review/` folder)

5. **`module-1.py`** - *Comprehensive Examples and Challenges* - (REQUIRED)
   - Complete worked examples of all Module 1 concepts
   - Practice challenges to reinforce learning
   - Reference material for syntax and techniques

6. **`module-1-practice-questions.py`** - *Extensive Practice Problems* - (REQUIRED EXCEPT FOR THE CHALLENGES)
   - practice questions organized by topic
   - Covers variables, arithmetic, string concatenation, and combined concepts
   - Includes challenge problems for advanced practice
   - Perfect for exam preparation

7. **`module-1-quiz.py`** - *Assessment Preparation* - (NOT REQUIRED)
   - Multiple choice questions
   - Coding problems
   - Short answer questions
   - Simulates quiz/exam format

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher installed
- Basic understanding of running Python files
- Text editor or IDE (VS Code recommended)

### Running the Files
1. Open your terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the lab directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/CS5001-FALL-2025-Lab2
   ```
3. Run any Python file:
   ```bash
   python3 filename.py
   ```

### Recommended Order
1. Start with `module-1.py` to review concepts
2. Work through exercises 1-4 in order
3. Use `module-1-practice-questions.py` for additional practice
4. Complete `module-1-quiz.py` to test your understanding

## Exercise Guidelines

### Exercise 1: Print House (`print_house.py`)
- **Goal**: Complete the ASCII art house
- **Skills**: Basic print statements, string formatting
- **Tip**: Pay attention to spacing and special characters

### Exercise 2: Song Lyrics (`song_lyrics.py`)
- **Goal**: Store 10 words of song lyrics in variables and print them
- **Skills**: Variable assignment, string concatenation
- **Tip**: Choose appropriate variable names and use + operator for concatenation

### Exercise 3: Arithmetic Operations (`diff_prod_avg.py`)
- **Goal**: Calculate difference, product, and average of two numbers
- **Skills**: Arithmetic operators, f-string formatting
- **Tip**: Remember that average requires division - ensure you get 7.5!

### Exercise 4: Time Calculator (`calculate_time.py`)
- **Goal**: Calculate what time an alarm will go off
- **Skills**: User input, modular arithmetic, problem-solving
- **Tip**: Use the % operator to handle 24-hour clock wraparound

## Key Concepts Review

### Variables
```python
# Variable assignment
name = "Alice"
age = 20
temperature = 98.6
```

### Arithmetic Operations
```python
# Basic operations
sum_val = 5 + 3      # Addition: 8
diff = 10 - 4        # Subtraction: 6
product = 6 * 7      # Multiplication: 42
quotient = 15 / 4    # Division: 3.75
remainder = 15 % 4   # Modulus: 3
```

### String Concatenation
```python
# Using + operator
greeting = "Hello" + " " + "World"

# Using f-strings (preferred)
name = "Alice"
age = 20
message = f"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old"
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Variable Names**: Use descriptive names, avoid Python keywords
2. **String Concatenation**: Remember spaces between words
3. **Division**: Use `/` for regular division, `//` for integer division
4. **Print Statements**: Check formatting matches expected output exactly
5. **Modulus Operator**: Remember `%` gives the remainder, not quotient

## Getting Help

If you're stuck:
1. Review the examples in `module-1.py`
2. Check the practice questions for similar problems
3. Ask your TA during office hours

## Assessment

Your work will be evaluated on:
- **Correctness**: Does your code produce the expected output?
- **Style**: Are you using appropriate variable names and formatting?
- **Completeness**: Have you completed all required parts?
- **Understanding**: Can you explain your solution approach?

## Success Tips

- Test your code frequently as you write it
- Use descriptive variable names
- Follow the exact output format shown in examples
- Ask questions if you're unsure about requirements
- Practice with the additional problems for deeper understanding
